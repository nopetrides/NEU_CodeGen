To play this example, you MUST select menu item Edit > Project Settings > Input.
Then increase Mouse ScrollWheel > Sensitivity to 1.

To set up this scene:

1. Unticked Input Device Manager > Detect Mouse Control. This prevents the mouse
   from deselecting the menu buttons.

2. Set the EventSystem's Vertical Axis to "Mouse ScrollWheel".

3. Replaced the response menu panel's StandardUIMenuPanel script with a custom
   script named FirewatchStyleMenuPanel.
