:: Start
You stand atop the mountain. Stormclouds churn above. Goru does not speak. A wide bowl rests on flat stone, waiting.

[[Toss a stone at the storm.|Stone]]
[[Place a berry in the bowl.|Berry]]
[[Cry out to Goru.|Shout]]

:: Stone
You throw a rock at the sky. The wind screams louder. Lightning splits the clouds — but only for a moment.

[[Try something else.|SecondChoices]]

:: Berry
You place a tear-shaped berry in the bowl. The storm hushes slightly. The wind whistles low, like a breath drawn in.

:: Shout
"Goru! I bear a relic. Will you not answer me?"

A crack of thunder, neither angry nor kind.

[[Try something else.|SecondChoices]]

:: SecondChoices
Still no god appears. But the air is different now — heavier. Watching.

Choose carefully.

[[Offer the relic directly.|OfferRelic]]
[[Hurl the relic into the storm.|DestroyRelic]]
[[Sit in silence beside the bowl.|Restraint]]

:: OfferRelic
You lift the relic high. "Take this. It is too dangerous to leave below."

The clouds rumble. Lightning dances at your feet — but does not strike.

[[Continue...|Reveal]]

:: DestroyRelic
You throw the relic into the storm. It vanishes mid-air, swallowed whole.

The wind rises violently. The offering bowl shatters.

[[Continue...|Reveal]]

:: Restraint
You sit. You say nothing. You do nothing. The relic rests by your side. The storm turns above you.

No flash. No sound. Just... calm.

:: Reveal
The clouds descend in coils of wind. Goru's voice is like thunder in your spine.

"You threw rocks. You shouted. You flailed. And then you waited."

His shape becomes clear — a great serpent of cloud and crackling arcs, head descending slowly.

"In restraint, there is wisdom. In silence, strength. I have watched long enough."

[[Receive the Storm’s Blessing|Blessed]]
[[Feel the Storm’s Wrath|Cursed]]

:: Blessed
The storm surrounds you. The relic glows softly. The wind wraps around your shoulders like a cloak.

You will descend with Goru’s favor. The storm watches with pride.

:: Cursed
The clouds coil away. You are alone.

When you descend, you find your name has been forgotten. Your people do not know you. The relic is gone. The storm has erased you.
